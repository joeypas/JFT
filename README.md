# J(oe's)F(ile)T(ransfer)

Library I created to be used to send and recive files over a local network. Uses Boost ASIO to help with socket programing. Currently local network transfer speeds are arround 500 mb/s but working to improve that.

## Install

To install and use this library
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
